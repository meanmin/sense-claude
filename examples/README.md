# Example: Flask Web Application

This is an optional example showing how to build a Flask web app with Cochl.Sense API.

## Files

- `app.py` - Flask backend with audio upload and analysis
- `templates/index.html` - Web interface for uploading audio files

## Running the Example

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Flask (if not already installed)
pip install flask

# Run the app
python examples/app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

## Note

This is just an example. The main plugin functionality works without this Flask app.
